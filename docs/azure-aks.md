# Create Azure Kubernetes Service using Terraform   

### Project Structure

This section of the project code is organized into two different sections,   
1. deployment: Declares how the modules are used to make the infrastructure template or the definition.
2. modules: Declares the structure of the module. A module might represent one Azure resource and what's required to provision it.
